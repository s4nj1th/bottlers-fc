A data analysis project born out of sheer boredom and frustration with football teams that just can't seem to get over the line. _(Disclaimer: This is 90% banter, 10% questionable math)_

## What's This About?

After watching my favorite team [redacted] snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (again), I decided to quantify which teams are the biggest "bottlers" in European football. Using match data from the top 5 leagues, this script:

1. Calculates league positions for each team over multiple seasons
2. Creates a "bottle score" that punishes teams for:
   - Finishing close to the top without winning (2nd place is pain)
   - Being in smaller leagues (it's harder to bottle a 20-team league than a 10-team one)
   - Recent failures (fresh wounds hurt more)
3. Exposes the most consistent underachievers in European football

## Bottle Score Formula

The **Bottle Score (BS)** quantifies how spectacularly a team fails to meet expectations:

$$
\text{BS} = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if league winners} \\
0.5^{\frac{i-2}{n-2}} \times w & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
i \rightarrow \text{League Position}\\
n \rightarrow \text{League Size}\\
w \rightarrow \text{Recency Weight}
$$

### Key Factors:

1. Position Penalty:

   - 2nd place hurts most (score = 1.0 before weighting)
   - Score decays exponentially for lower positions
   - Champions get 0 (they did their job)

2. League Size Normalization:

   - Bottling in a 20-team league (EPL) is harder than in a 10-team league

3. Recency Weight:

   - Recent failures (2020) count 3√ó
   - Older seasons (2014) count 1√ó
   - Linear scaling in between

**Example**:

A 2nd place finish in 2020 (20-team league):

```
(0.5)^(0) √ó 3 = 3.0 BS
```

_(Peak bottling performance!)_

**Disclaimer**:
This is _clearly_ an unscientific, tongue-in-cheek metric created for banter purposes.

## The Results Are In!

The biggest bottlers according to my _\*highly scientific\*_ metric:

- **Premier League**: Tottenham (because of course)
- **La Liga**: Atletico Madrid
- **Bundesliga**: Borussia Dortmund
- **Serie A**: Roma (with Napoli close behind)
- **Ligue 1**: Lyon

_Full disclosure: My team (Arsenal) appears suspiciously high in these rankings, which I can only assume is a data error._
